# Aneurysm Pressure Prediction using 3D Geometry

This project predicts pressure, velocity-gradient and wall shear stress in cerebral vasculature using machine learning models trained on geometrical and physical features extracted from DICOM-derived datasets.

## ðŸš€ How to Run

### Step 1: Install dependencies

pip install -r requirements.txt


### Step 2: Train or Predict

python src/main.py


The model will train on the provided vascular geometry and pressure datasets.  
You can modify `main.py` to input new coordinates and predict pressure using the trained models.

---

## Model Details

This pipeline supports several machine learning models, including:

- Random Forest Regressor
- Support Vector Regression (SVR)
- Linear Regression
- Convolution Neural Network

It uses 3D coordinate-based vascular geometry and associated pressure/velocity metrics for training.  
Once trained, the model can return pressure predictions for new geometrical inputs. Similarly it can predict velocity-gradient and wall shear stress based on the geometry.

---

## Data Notes

- All input CSVs should be placed in the `data/` directory.
- Prediction results will be saved in the `results/` directory.
- Trained model files are saved to or loaded from the `models/` directory.
